# MarkMage

MarkMage is a PDF generator where you can write Markdown and get it converted to HTML via a liveview window. This way you can see how the PDF will turnout if you choose to export it! MarkMage also gives you the option to change text font from a selection of fonts as well as the desired color on both text and background of the PDF document. There is also text-alignment options for left, right and center.

## Installation

In order to use MarkMage you will need to install node to be able to run `npm` commands.

When MarkMage and node is installed you need to run `npm install` in the console/terminal.

This will install the required packages that MarkMage uses to do its magic!

When everything is installed you should be good to go! Just type `npm start` in the console and the server will start!
